# Capstone project


The aim of the project is to explore different methodologies to build and implement a recommender system that will recommend movies based on information from the MovieLens dataset. This dataset will be updated with data scraped from the corresponding IMDb pages for each movie.

Collaborative filtering and content based filtering, will be used on the cleaned dataset and their accurary at predicting ratings will be evaluated.

Finally a basic recommender system will be built based on the most accurate model.
