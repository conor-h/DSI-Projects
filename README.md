**Capstone** - Movie Recommender System
The aim of the project was to explore different methodologies to build and implement a simple recommender system that would recommend movies based on information from the MovieLens dataset. This dataset was updated with data scraped from the corresponding IMDb pages for each movie. The recommendation engine was based on the cleaned dataset and the accuracy of the predicted ratings was evaluted.
The folder is constantly being updated as the project is still ongoing.
