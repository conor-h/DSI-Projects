In this folder you will find projects completed while attending General Assembly (GA), Data Science immersive Course.



Projects:

1. **Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis of SAT scores**

The project focuses on exploratory statistical analysis and visualizations of a simple dataset of SAT scores. Matplotlib, Seaborn and Tableau have been used for visualizations.

_key words:_
Exploratory Data Analysis | Data Visualization

2. **Project 2 - Regression and Classification with the Ames Housing Data**

This project is based on data from Kaggle competition, containing 79 features describing residential properties in Ames, Iowa.

The dataset was cleaned and visualised,  examining potential correlations between features in the EDA phaseI predicted the price of the houses with Linear Regression using only fixed characteristics of the house features.

Next I used the non-fixed characteristics of the house features, together with residuals from the first Linear Regression to explain any remaining variance in the price.

The last part of the project focused on predicting 'abnormal' category of sales, using Logistic Regression.

_key words:_
Supervised Machine Learning - Linear model| Linear Regression | Ridge and Lasso Regression

3. **Project 3 - Web Scraping for Indeed.com & Predicting Salaries**

In this project, I practiced two major skills: collecting data by scraping a website and then building a binary predictor with Logistic Regression.

I collected salary information on data science jobs in a variety of markets in the US. Then using the location, title and summary of the job I predicted the salary of the job.

_key words:_
Web Scraping | Data Cleaning | Supervised Machine Learning - Classification model| Logistic Regression | Hyperparameter optimization

**Capstone - Movie Recommender System**
The aim of the project was to explore different methodologies to build and implement a simple recommender system that would recommend movies based on information from the MovieLens dataset. This dataset was updated with data scraped from the corresponding IMDb pages for each movie. The recommendation engine was based on the cleaned dataset and the accuracy of the predicted ratings was evaluted.
