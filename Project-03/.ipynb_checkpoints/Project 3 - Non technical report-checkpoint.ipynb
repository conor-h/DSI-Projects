    "\n",
    "As a rapidly expanding consultancy the main focus is to be competitive in the hiring market. To achieve this there needs to be an accurate gauge of salary amounts, taking into account what industry factors influence the pay scale for these professionals. We need to juggle offering attractive salaries to contractors while providing value for money to the clients. \n",

    "Along with the salary information, the location, job title, job summary, and company name were recorded. After some initial data cleaning, key factors for predicting the salary were selected. \n",

    "- Key words\n",
    "    - Job title\n",
    "    - Job summary \n",
    "    \n",
    "Using these predictors were able to estimate whether a job would have a high or low salary in relation to the median salary for Data Science roles ($73,000). This was done by running the identified predictor variables through several statistical models to find best model for out research. \n",

    "Several cities also were factors in getting paid a higher salary, Boston, San Francisco and San Jose were the front runners. Again this is to be expected and they are centres of tech education and innovation.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of our main concerns as a business was not pricing correctly for our serices and/or over paying consultants. Using our model we can assuade our concerns."

    "- Get more detailed job summaries for the roles and a perform key word search again to get more accurate predictors\n",
